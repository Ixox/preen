Preen Current Features

. 9 different FM alogorithms with up to 6 operators
  Each operator includes an oscillator and ADSR enveloppe
  Oscillator : 7 waveforms (4 sin variation + noise + square + sawtooth), 
  linked to keyb freq or fix, fine tune

. Up to 4 voice polyphony with 3 operators FM algoriyhm
  Up to 3 voice polyphony with 4 operators FM algoriyhm 
  and up to 2 with 6 operators FM algoriyhm.

. Glide available when voice set to 1

. 3 standard LFOs (4 waveforms (saw, ramp, square, random), frequency in Hz, ramp up to 4 seconds, reset on new note).
. 1 Enveloppe type LFO 
. 2 Step sequencers LFO (16 steps) : independant gate value and BPM. Their scale allow controlling pitch in semitones.

. 12 rows modulation matrix - 14 different sources and 33 destinations.

. 4 banks of 128 user presets

. System exclusive to exchange patches and banks with a computer

. Midi control : 44 control input/output control changes linked to parameters
  Nrpn : input/ouput of all paremeters
  Midi channel selectable : Midi for other channges can be forwarded to plug several PreenFM in serial

. Large readable 4x20 LCD 

. Friendly surface controle : You always clearly see on the screen what you're currently editing

. Sampling rate : 32768 Hz (Makes integer division faster ;-). Pseudo 11 bits.
  1024 Hz for LFO and modulation matrix

. Test note : play note without keyboard. Pitch and velocity editable.

. 6th order butterworth analog filter to convert the 1 bit output into a nice waveform

. Transparent case that allows you to see every day your nice work
